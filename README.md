=============

    Calculates the probability of the lengths of repetitions given any number e.g.

    For the numbers with length 6,
        6 repetitions of length 1 
        - e.g. 123456
        - Probability of Repetitions: 59049 / 100000

        4 repetitions of length 1, 1 repetition of length 2 
        - e.g. 112345, 122345, 123345, 123445, 123455
        - Probability of Repetitions: 32805 / 100000

        2 repetitions of length 1, 2 repetitions of length 2
        - Probability of Repetitions: 4374 / 100000

        3 repetitions of length 2
        - Probability of Repetitions: 81 / 100000

        3 repetitions of length 1, 1 repetition of length 3
        - Probability of Repetitions: 2916 / 100000

        1 repetition of length 1, 1 repetition of length 2, 1 repetition of length 3
        - Probability of Repetitions: 486 / 100000

        2 repetitions of length 3
        - Probability of Repetitions: 9 / 100000

        2 repetitions of length 1, 1 repetition of length 4
        - Probability of Repetitions: 243 / 100000

        1 repetition of length 2, 1 repetition of length 4
        - Probability of Repetitions: 18 / 100000

        1 repetition of length 1, 1 repetition of length 5
        - Probability of Repetitions: 18 / 100000

        1 repetition of length 6
        - Probability of Repetitions: 1 / 100000
